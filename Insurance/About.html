        <h3>What we do for you</h3>
        <p>If you experience a covered medical event, such as a hospital stay, then a hospital indemnity pays a set fee in cash directly to you or the hospital designated by you. More than just hospital insurance, 
            our products can also include supplemental indemnity payments for a critical illness diagnosis or unexpected accidents.
